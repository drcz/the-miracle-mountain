-= THE MIRACLE MOUNTAIN =-

This game I've been working on mostly at nights, on December 2014, February, March and April 2015.

As an art director I am more than pleased with the result; as a programmer I remain silent.

Its premiere was on International Workers' Day (original site got removed).
You can play it here, on gh-pages: http://drcz.github.io/the-miracle-mountaint/

I made two advertisements in case the tv was interested:

Special thanks go to Jakub D. for detailed testing and providing me with room and other asortiments,
to Panicz Godek, Mr Piotruś, Mr Kubak and my wife for testing and encouragement,
to Edek for convincing me to write a game instead of some proof-of-concept-not-really-an-engine-something,
to Sylwester Gałuszka of Kolonia Artystów for inviting me to play at StreetWaves 2014 (recording of that performance is part of the soundtrack),
to soundcloud.com for hosting my drones,
and finally to myself, without whom the game would not come into existence (what?).


As you can see in the intro, all the resources and the game itself are copyleft.
